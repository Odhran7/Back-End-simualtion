# V2 Technical Architecture This is a feasibility check for the decentralised identity back-end system that I am proposing for the launch of V2 Dapp. 

Will eventually be made much more complex and add references to on-chain attestations that will include NFT (for bounty completion) and various other on-chain activities such as post/comment creation. This is revolutionary within the space and will be using Ceramic as the data-registry
